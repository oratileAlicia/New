**Action:**  
Through the Interview Skills module, I learned about the CAR method and practiced answering questions in a more structured way. I also attended two real interviews, where I discovered that each company asks questions differently and realized the importance of researching the company beforehand.  

**Result:**  
These experiences helped me feel more confident and prepared for future interviews. I now know how to tailor my answers to match the company‚Äôs values and expectations while staying calm and focused throughout the process.

**Action:** 
Although I was nervous, I focused on clear articulation and applied what I learned from the interview skills module.

I realized that I tend to speak too quickly when anxious, which can affect clarity. This experience taught me the importance of controlling my pace and breathing during interviews to maintain professionalism.  

### **Evidence:**
